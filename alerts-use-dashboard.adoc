View at-a-glance information about the potential risks in your ONTAP system. You can quickly identify ONTAP clusters that have low capacity or low performance, gauge the extent of availability, determine availability, and identify security risks.

You can see information about these severities and impact areas: 

* *Severities*: Critical, Warning, Informational
* *Impact areas*: Capacity, Performance, Availability, Protection, Security, Configuration

== Alerts you might see
Here are some of the alerts that display.

The EMS severity maps to the ONTAP alerts severity in the following ways:

.Steps

. link:alerts-start-login.html[Log in to the NetApp Console]. 
. From the Console left navigation bar, select *Storage* > *Alerts*. 
+
After discovery, the Alerts list page shows a list of alerts in your ONTAP system. 
+
There might be a delay between an event happening and ONTAP alerts showing it.

. From the Alerts list page, you can view and do any of the following: 

* Change the sort order by clicking the up or down arrow for a column. 
* Change the filter in the columns to show only the information you want. 
+
TIP: For example, you might want to see only those alerts related to capacity. To do so, select the filter icon on the Impact area column, select *Capacity*, and select *Apply*.
+

* Download a CSV file containing the alerts information. 
+
You can download up to 1000 alerts. The file includes data based on the filters that were set. 
* Select an alert and drill into the alert details on that cluster. See link:alerts-use-alerts.html[View alert details].
